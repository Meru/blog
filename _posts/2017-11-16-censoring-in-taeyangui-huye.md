description: Ramblings about censoring(?) in K-Drama 태양의 후예
---
So I was trying to watch 태양의 후예 (Taeyang-ui Huye) EP01, because I heard it's good...  
At the beginning it was pretty decent, up until the scene above. What is **that**?
Why they had to blur all the knives???  
It is not always all that obvious due to motion blur and such, but after all
it is censored!  
Perhaps I could *somewhat* understand this (but not agree with it), but something
else bothers me. Why are these knives worth censoring? Especially that there is
no censoring on the knife and firearm images such as the one below,
which are IMO far worse...
